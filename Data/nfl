Join me in my deep-dive into the six biggest games from this past weekend.

## San Francisco 49ers (3-3) @ Atlanta Falcons (3-3):

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img flqw1rmi4zu91...*

&amp;#x200B;

### 49ers O vs. Falcons D:

Let me just start this way ‚Äì the Falcons deservedly won this game and I think they would have done so either way, but things could have looked very different from the start. On the initial third down of the  day for San Francisco‚Äôs offense, Jimmy G was gun-shy when he could‚Äôve hit George Kittle for a 66-yard touchdown most likely, as they showed a  simple spacing concept out of a bunch set and I‚Äôm not totally sure if Kittle just decided to take it vertical because of something they had discussed in team meetings or if this was by design and he just got up  with the safety having outside leverage, but he ended up just throwing  that guy off himself and the deep middle safety is working his way up. So if Jimmy just steps up with plenty of green grass right in front of  him and puts it out in front, the score is 7-7. I had to smirk when I  first saw him consciously try to push the ball vertically outside the numbers when Garoppolo was first inserted for the injured Trey Lance,  but he simply puts a lid on this passing attack and makes everything feel more condensed, relying so heavily on those play-makers to create yards after the catch.

And don‚Äôt get me wrong, that‚Äôs not a bad formula, looking at the guys  they have there, but it makes things so much easier for a defense, when  they are allowed to constantly play with their eyes in the backfield and working up rather than gaining depth. You look at how aggressively Atlanta was shooting through gaps and flowing to the football, you start  to understand how they held the Niners to a season-low 50 yards on the  ground on 16 attempts. Yet, that‚Äôs when they need to be able to rely  upon Jimmy to take advantage of the space that provides his receivers to work with. Brandon Aiyuk finally had his breakout game, hauling in  eight passes for 83 and their two touchdowns. Kyle Shanahan needs to continue to utilize him as heavily, considering what he can do on designed touches, but also leaving an All-Pro corner in A.J. Terrell behind in the dust on whip routes.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing video 1lndv1uk4zu91...*

&amp;#x200B;

Like I just said, the Falcons D played with a ton of energy and  clearly were instructed by DC Dean Pees to attack downhill as soon as they saw the O-line step forward, as well as meet pullers as early as  possible and not even allow those extra gaps to develop in the first place. When not getting called for phantom roughing the passer penalties, Grady Jarrett has been an absolute monster for this Falcons  defense, making a couple of disruptive plays every week. Something that I  hated early on in his career, when I felt like that Dan Quinn coaching staff misplaced him, due to not having anybody else to play that spot,  was lining him up a lot as the 1-technique, but it made a lot of sense  in this matchup. From there, he was able to create penetration right up the A-gap and then did a great job either riding first-year center Jake Brendel down the line on the backside or working over the top late, as  the ball-carrier approached, to hold him up.

Atlanta played a ton of single-high coverages, daring the 49ers to attack them on the perimeter, while blowing up several screen passes on the day. You like the growth these young guys are continuing to show, like Arnold Ebiketie flashing off the edge a couple of times, Troy Andersen‚Äôs speed on that second level, how those two safeties operate together. It‚Äôs a continuous process, but this was certainly encouraging going up against a very creative offensive scheme, looking at the coaching clues and ability to execute by the individual players.

&amp;#x200B;

### Falcons O vs. 49ers D:

Here‚Äôs a stat I just loved from the Falcons offense on Sunday ‚Äì they used each 11, 12, 13, 21 and 22 personnel on over 10% of snaps.  They do so much window-dressing and they‚Äôre able to be very diverse regardless of personnel on the field, where they can dictate the  defensive package they‚Äôll be facing or adjust depending on how opponents try to match them, because they can use guys like Kyle Pitts ‚Äì who finally scored his first touchdown as an NFL player in the US ‚Äì out wide as a legit X receiver or put him in-line and force a sub-200 pound  nickelback to fill the C-gap. Atlanta stays true to their identity, no matter who they have toting the rock. They had two rookies ‚Äì fifth-round pick Tyler Allgeier and undrafted free agent Caleb Huntley ‚Äì carried  the ball 15 and 16 times respectively. All those guys they have back there, especially once they get back Cordarelle Patterson, run so hard  and gain yards through contact. They‚Äôre now number three behind only the Browns and Bears with 165.2 rushing yards per game and they‚Äôve only  failed to reach 150 once (Rams ‚Äì 90).

That O-line has really impressed me with their ability to create movement laterally on wide zone schemes and their burst to secure linebackers off combos. Somebody like right tackle Kaleb McGary has gone from fringe starter to somebody they can utilize as a key piece, like they did a couple of times kicking out the corner on crack toss plays. They were able to create some favorable looks off play-action and when they did actually drop back, Arthur Smith did a great job of clearing  out the picture with motions and horizontal stretches, along with giving Mariota a back-side alert, where he can hit Drake London on back-shoulder fades, which are borderline indefensible. They also got a  couple of easy conversions with Olamide Zaccheus out in the flats, with Kyle Pitts picking for him. Plus, then off course his legs can be a big  factor, as he kept three times and was able to get around the corner ‚Äì once for the touchdown to go up 21-14 just before halftime ‚Äì and had a huge scramble right up the middle to convert a third-and-12.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing video zzoz5ehm4zu91...*

&amp;#x200B;

There‚Äôs really not that much to say about the 49ers defense. A couple of times early in the game, they were able to crush the pocket and take down Mariota, but they‚Äôre just banged up and were tired, with their  opponents running the ball 40 times on the day. I‚Äôm not overly concerned about anything I saw, in terms of getting blown off the ball or guys  behind the line moving themselves out of position. They did hold the Falcons to 4.2 yards per carry and below 3.5 if you take out Mariota, and it‚Äôs not like they‚Äôll need to match full house sets with two  full-backs really in any other games this season, where we saw the Niners needing to bring out what usually are substitute players at linebacker and safety to match those. So really, Atlanta made them put guys on the field they didn‚Äôt want, because if they didn‚Äôt, that would leave sub-200 pound guys having to set the edge and things like that.

Charvarius Ward getting banged up in the first half, along with just  having lost Emmanuel Moseley for the rest of the year, forced them to put a lot of young guys on the field, when they really needed to use  their other resources to stop the run and put those guys in tough matchups. And not having Jimmie Ward right now if somebody that they  felt as well, just considering how comfortable DC DeMeco Ryans has been  with letting that other safety attack forward and how tremendous Talanoa  Hufanga has been playing with that mind-set to trigger as soon as his eyes tell him to. One of San Francisco‚Äôs two sacks was for zero yards  and then on just two of the other 54 plays they were able to create  negative yardage. Going against an offense, that is constantly ahead or at least on schedule is very hard for a defense, that wants to run a bunch of games up front and really attack upfield. Not having their best guy at setting the edge and simultaneously at turning the corner in passing situations with Nick Bosa wasn‚Äôt helpful in that regard either.

&amp;#x200B;

### Closing thoughts:

Like I mentioned, the Niners are certainly a very banged-up team, but  put some respect on Arthur Smith being able to put 21 points on them in the first half and then close out the game in the second, with one more  touchdown and a relentless run game. Marcus Mariota had an ultra-efficient day, completing 13 of 14 pass attempts for 129 yards and  two TDs, along with another 50 yards and a score on six carries. He didn‚Äôt throw the ball more than 20 times in any of Atlanta‚Äôs three wins. At a time where the NFL goes to all these three-wide receiver sets and  two-high shells defensively, they are going the exact opposite way and punishing teams for giving them favorable looks to run against. The  defense is pressuring the passer on a league-low 12.2% of dropbacks and only the Titans have recorded fewer tackles for loss (19), but Dean Pees has a great feel for when and how to change up the picture, while having everybody pursue the ball with relentless effort. I just can‚Äôt  get over how good that coaching staff has been at understanding their personnel, having a couple of new wrinkles every week for their opponents and how sound they have their guys playing.

Flipping things around, being able to overcome injuries and also  getting some of those guys back eventually on 49ers side will be key. FOX‚Äôs Sports Doc Matt currently has them dead-last in B.U.S. (banged-up score). I believe when  they get back Trent Williams at left tackle and Elijah Mitchell as  their RB1, that run game will kick into gear only more, but in matchups like this past Sunday, Jimmy G has to be able to make those big throws  down the field, which he really had one of, hitting Brandon Aiyuk with a lot of separation on a corner route to the field. Two positives for  their offense ‚Äì the protection was pretty darn clean throughout the day,  allowing Jimmy G to literally hang back there at the top of his drop on several occasions, and George Kittle is back to looking like a  monster-truck rumbling through defenders in his path again. The defense will need those young corners to step up with Moseley out for the year, but I‚Äôm not concerned with some key contributors slated to return soon.

## New York Jets (4-2) @ Green Bay Packers (3-3):

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img 33ixgkcv4zu91...*

&amp;#x200B;

### Jets O vs. Packers D:

I really like what offensive coordinator Mike LaFleur is doing right  now, particularly in the run game. On Sunday, you see them set up plays  with the way they threatened the edges a series of toss plays, either  cracking down with receivers in reduced splits or using guys on the move  of motion as lead-blockers. Plus, that 20-yard touchdown by Braxton  Berrios, where they pulled the guard and tight-end one way, with the  latter pivoting back around and landing the key block on the corner. And  then off that, they had a couple of really cool designs, where they  ultimately handed it to Breece, not only the long touchdown in the  fourth quarter, where they faked a reverse on a GT power play, but also  earlier in the first half, where they lined him up as the offset  receiver in a bunch set, and used the tight-end inside of him on a lead  sweep play, after faking the toss to their original side with Michael  Carter Jr.

I also loved a screen play they ran in the fourth quarter, where they  motioned the Z receiver in a two-by-two set across and showed what  looked like the trips side on a four verts concept and then got the ball  to the tight-end on the opposite side after acting like he‚Äôs in  protection, to where he had three linemen out in front, with a ton of  space. The crazy part about what the Jets have been able to do is that  second-year quarterback Zach Wilson ‚Äì who I predicted to have a breakout  season ‚Äì isn‚Äôt playing well at all right now. Whether it‚Äôs being a tick  late on route plays or the ball-placement being off, which was on  display on a couple of intermediate routes to the sideline, which could  have led to conversions if those passes are on the screws. And he made a  horrible decision, which almost cost them an easy field-goal, as he  threw it up into the end-zone whilst falling out of bounds on third  down, and the ball was nearly picked off.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

It‚Äôs kind of been the same old story for the Packers ‚Äì they can‚Äôt  stop the better run games in the league consistently. After finishing 30th  in yards allowed per carry last season, they‚Äôre right on pace yet again  at 4.7 yards per. We can go into Joe Barry‚Äôs lack of willingness to  drop one of his safeties down into the cadence of the quarterback, maybe  blitz the run more on early downs and other factors, but really what it  comes down to is that their individual players in the box have to play  better. That‚Äôs highly disappointing, considering their nose-tackle and  two linebackers earn in the double-digit millions per year, plus they  just drafted two guys from Georgia‚Äôs historically great defense in the  first round. Quay Walker in particular has been a complete liability  against the run, with a PFF run-defense grade of 29.9 ‚Äì and Rashan Gary  is actually the only player in the front-seven with a grade of 70+. As a  unit, the defense is the worst in the league in terms of EPA allowed  per rush in two-high looks, which their DC seems to have no concern  living in, because that‚Äôs what he believes in schematically.

We did finally see him allow Jaire Alexander to play more press-man  coverage, even though he was going up against the Z on the field side  more regularly, and he locked up guys like Corey Davis and Garrett all  day long. They didn‚Äôt nearly do a good enough job of beating blockers to  the spot, to funnel the ball back towards their team-mates or replacing  those guys when necessary, frequently allowed the Jets to get to the  perimeter. And then off that, even when New York used soft play-action  fakes from the gun, there were some wide open passing lanes over the  middle, as Walker had followed pulling linemen and the safeties were  kind of frozen at their spots.

&amp;#x200B;

### Packers O vs. Jets D:

Green Bay tried so hard to get out to the edges with wide zone and  toss plays against a team with great speed on the second level and more  than willing tacklers on the perimeter. They had their most success in  that regard handing the ball to A.J. Dillon from the shotgun on power or  trap plays, when the defense was in that wide-nine front and playing  the pass. And their backs should have hit those cutbacks more regularly,  looking at how hard the backside linebacker chased on lateral run  schemes. Aaron Jones once did and ripped off a big chunk, but Elgton  Jenkins was called for pretty much a panic hold. When they did drop  back, it was a ton of quick game and West Coast concepts, which nobody  was able to really create any clear windows with early separation  against man and then against zone, they basically got no yardage after  the catch.

Due to that, the Packers got to third down 19(!) times in this game,  with eight of those for seven or more yards. Other than three first  downs gifted to them by penalties, they went 4-of-16. I‚Äôll get to what  the Jets did up front in a second here, but when Rodgers actually needed  to read the field and work through progressions, he never really felt  comfortable behind his O-line, to allow things to develop down the  field, where he doesn‚Äôt trust those young guys and would rather hold  onto the ball an extra beat, to see them work their way open. At this  point, it‚Äôs also hilarious how you can count on Rodgers taking a deep  shot, whenever the other team put together a longer (scoring) drive. And  those balls aren‚Äôt bad, but he doesn‚Äôt really have a guy who will make  those plays for him on the back-end regularly.

&amp;#x200B;

For the Jets, Sauce Gardner has transformed what they are on the  back-end, with the physicality he brings and the confidence the coaching  staff and he himself have in the number four overall pick. They can  leave him one-on-one with the X receiver consistently and have been  playing man-coverage on third down as much as any other unit in the  league, allowing with the team speed they have to shut everything down  to the edges or thrown in front of him. You combine that with all the  games they run on the D-line, with as many variatons of picks, stunts,  twist, etc. as you can imagine, to where they realized like a quarter  into Sunday to stop blitzing. They pressured Rodgers on a season-low  percentage of dropbacks, but they sacked him four times, routinely made  the walls around him close in and the Packers O-line was called for  holding twice.

Multiple times you‚Äôd see Rodgers try to step into creases like you‚Äôd  see on a pocket presence drill, but exactly there a delayed looper would  show up. Quinnen Williams was a monster, looking like the number one  overall prospect I had him as in the 2019 draft, crashing across the  face of offensive linemen and dominating every solo-block he went up  against basically. One more player I want to shout out ‚Äì I just love  watching Jordan Whitehead charge up the alley in the run game and what  he provides buzzing down, to blow up blockers, which has allowed Gang  Green to be one of four defenses to surrender less than four yards per  carry, despite losing their best run-defender from a year ago in  nose-tackle Folorunso Fatukasi. Having that quasi plus-one in the box,  even though the offense largely can‚Äôt account for it, has been key in  that regard.

&amp;#x200B;

### Closing thoughts:

The development of this Jets defense is the biggest talking point  here, closely followed by how capped this Packers offense feels like  right now. This is the type of unit I envisioned when Robert Saleh came  to New York, as they finally have all the pieces in place, whether it‚Äôs  the young guys finding their ways or veterans being healthy. And then I  like what Mike LaFleur has built in the run game. If they can Zach  Wilson to get the ball out a touch quicker and a couple inches further  towards where his receivers are heading, they can play the kind of  complete football to beat pretty much anybody. However, let‚Äôs not gloss  over the fact that Wilson had 110 yards passing and the offense went  1-of-11 on third downs for the day. They won‚Äôt have a punt blocked for a  touchdown every week. So far they‚Äôve only played the Dolphins once at  home from their division ‚Äì who they beat up pretty good. They‚Äôll have  plenty of chances to prove themselves still.

For Green Bay, for how much they want to play two-high coverages,  they simply don‚Äôt have the guys in the front-seven, to keep opponents  behind the chains and eliminate explosives on the ground. They have the  corners to take risks with being vulnerable outside and use those other  resources to spill and fill. While offensively, I don‚Äôt see much of a  solution with the personnel they have there right now. Rodgers has that  ability to identify spatial advantages and get the ball out in a hurry,  but if those receivers don‚Äôt create that quick separation like Davante  Adams was able to or make something happen with it, if they do catch the  ball, you will get to third-and-long ‚Äì and then I don‚Äôt fully trust the  receivers or O-line respectively to make the right route adjustments on  the fly or hold up long enough in pass-pro, if Rodgers has to pull the  ball down. I‚Äôd really like to see them move Elgton Jenkins back to right  guard, where he‚Äôs been an All Pro selection, and then try Yosh Nijman  or one of their rookies at tackle next to him, where they can chip and  slide that way, to help, now that David Bakhtiari is back on the  blindside. And as it sounds like their QB is desperate for, they need to  make some kind of move at receiver.

## Baltimore Ravens (3-3) @ New York Giants (5-1):

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img b0gvrdiz4zu91...*

&amp;#x200B;

### Ravens O vs. Giants D:

This is probably the game I have the least to write about, because I  really felt like the Ravens were in control for most of the day, yet  they gave away another multi-score lead and the Giants just kept hanging  around and making the plays needed to be victorious at the end.

Looking at the Ravens rushing success in this game, it really was all  Lamar Jackson keeping the ball around the corner or pulling and going  downhill on invert veer concepts. As far as their bnacks are converted,  power schemes were by far the most effective for them, either pulling  the backside guard and tackle or having the fullback kick-out the  end-man at the line of scrimmage and making the guard lead up into the  hole. Kenyan Drake had 76 yards and a touchdowns on six of those alone.  J.K. Dobbins unfortunately didn‚Äôt look like himself from a couple of  years ago, trying to bubble around traffic and trying to delay things  near the point of attack. He finished the day with seven carries for  just 15 yards (and no catches).

Baltimore lived in 21 personnel for the majority of this contest,  with fullback Patrick Ricard playing an absurd 76% of offensive snaps ‚Äì a  fullback, in the 21st century. And the cool thing about them  is that you see them line up in an offset I-formation from the pistol  and run dive option one play and they motion into empty with Ricard at  tight-end as a chip-and-release guy, giving Lamar a clear picture as  they spread out the defense, while they have to match with base  personnel and can afford Lamar solid protection. And something I liked  as well in that regard was the way they‚Äôd use their backs to clear out  space to work over the middle of the field for Mark Andrews, at times  off motions or creating four-strong looks.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing gif d0k4e52f8zu91...*

&amp;#x200B;

Wink Martindale had a few really fun wrinkles incorporated into the  game-plan, like on the final play of Baltimore‚Äôs opening drive, when  they wanted to run their patented counter bash concept with Lamar and  the Giants had basically had three guys just standing behind the other  over the c, enter before going different ways at the snap and blowing up  the play, because the O-line wasn‚Äôt sure who they were responsible for,  making Lamar try to reverse field and ultimately get taken down for a  big TFL, which pushed them out of field goal range. In the pass game,  the G-Men ran some intricate games up front, including some layered  three-man stunts, where they made it almost impossible for the Ravens  O-line to pick it up, with a late looper coming free.

Looking at the box score, Mark Andrews was the only consistent target  in the pass game for Baltimore, catching seven passes for 106 yards and  a touchdown. No other Ravens player had more than three catches or 30  yards. However, that 12-yard score ‚Äì which was a perfect ball by Lamar  on a slot fade route ‚Äì was the only ball they allowed the tight-end to  grab over the final 26 minutes, as Wink started to play primarily  one-robber, where they‚Äôd have a guy carrying Andrews vertically with  outside leverage and dropped the safety to that side down, to take away  that inside access towards the middle. Fifth overall pick Kayvon  Thibodeaux did a great job on a couple of plays, forcing Lamar to hand  the ball off and then corralling the back. Julian Love had some  excellent reps in coverage, one-on-one against Mark Andrews and covering  ground as a deep zone defender, to disrupt the catch point, allowing  that game-turning pick off Lamar, that set up the G-Men to take their  first lead of the game with just two minutes.

&amp;#x200B;

### Giants O vs. Ravens D:

Similar to what I said about the Falcons near the top of the article ‚Äì  the Giants coaches understand the personnel they have to work with.  They simply don‚Äôt have any complete receivers that they can rely upon,  to consistently create separation in his matchups, in order to work  those. But they have a special talent in Saquon Barkley, who they  understood the Ravens would always have most eyes on and opened up  opportunities for his teammates to make plays. He did touch the ball 25  times on the day, to keep their opponents honest, but he was really more  so a decoy. Rookie receiver Wan‚ÄôDale Robinson gave Big Blue a nice  spark and found the end-zone for the first time as a pro, on a little  pick play to the flats, but we saw them use a ton of 12 and some 21  ‚Äúpony‚Äù personnel on the day (their wildcat package with two tailbacks),  because Brian Daboll probably feels like they can be the most diverse  out of those.

You see some play-designs that nobody else in the league has run this  season. I put a clip here of this play they ran on their first  touchdown drive midway through the second quarter, where they were in 31  personnel with three actual tailbacks, fake the dive with the deep back  and put Daniel Jones on the move of this front-side bootleg, where he  has Saquon out in the flats and Matt Breida wheeling up the sideline. He  hit the latter, as the safety to that side tried to take away Barkley  underneath, for 15 yards. And as much as people want to crap on Daniel  Jones ‚Äì which has been fair at points ‚Äì he delivered some crucial plays  on third downs, going 7-of-11 on the day, with conversions of 14, 12 and  a touchdown. They hit some deep crossers to extend drives and some of  other cool designs in the pass game, throughout the day, where they used  the eyes of Ravens defenders being on Barkley against them.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing gif c56ts35g8zu91...*

&amp;#x200B;

Baltimore‚Äôs defense for the majority of the day was able to hold  Saquon Barkley in check. He had just 95 yards on those 25 touches, with  none of them going for more than eight yards. That was thanks to having  the guys on the interior to hold up against double-teams on more  vertical run schemes and great pursuit whenever he was threatening out  to the edges. However, while they did get some good hits on Daniel Jones  in the pocket, he deserves credit for standing tall to deliver the  ball, while those DBs on the back-end couldn‚Äôt plaster the receivers  quite well enough to avoid that little bit of late separation. And right  now, other than Justin Madubuike knifing through a couple of times per  game, they don‚Äôt have anybody who can consistently win his pass-rush  reps one-on-one.

Patrick Queen got close to Jones on a couple of wrap-around blitzes,  where they could have gotten the Giants off the field on third downs,  but both Barkley and Breida had tremendous pass-pro reps, allowing their  quarterback to step into the throw and deliver big conversions.  Baltimore is tied for the third-most takeaways in the league (12) and  one of only four teams with at least one of those in each of their six  games. They got another in this contest, but that strip-sack on the  final play before halftime was pretty much meaningless. The only big one  they nearly had came at the two-minute warning at the end of the game,  when Marcus Peters was called for pass interference in the end-zone, and  Saquon scored on a goal-line leap on the very next snap.

&amp;#x200B;

### Closing thoughts:

This is now their third loss this season after leading by  double-digit points in the fourth quarter. And once again, there were  way too many costly mistakes. Up 7-0, they have the Giants stopped on a 3rd-and-4,  with a screen to Richie James coming a yard short, but John Harbaugh  decides to push New York back ten yards on an offensive pass  interference call, only for them to convert on a deep curl to Darius  Slayton. Lamar missed Devin Duvernay for a touchdown right after the  two-minute warning in the first half, who had a step on the safety on a  corner-route in the high red-zone, and then put it out maybe a couple of  inches too far him on a drag route early on in the second half. They  ended up settling for field goals on both of those drives. Then up by  three, with as many minutes left on a third-and-one, they get called for  an illegal formation on what would have been a conversion on a QB  sneak, and they have that odd snap exchange on the very next snap, where  the ball goes through Lamar‚Äôs hands, but instead of throwing it away as  they running out to the sideline, he goes back across his body and gets  picked off by Julian Love. Marcus Peters get called for pass  interference on third-and-goal, where the receiver tried to push off and  his reaction was to grab cloth, before Saquon leaps over the top of the  pile, to put the Giants up by four. And finally, Lamar gets  strip-sacked by Thibodeaux, to seal the deal. Oh, and Justin Tucker  missed a 56-yard field goal attempt at the end of the second drive on  the day, which is also very uncommon. Those are simply way too many  miscues in a game that they should have really won.

The Giants on the other hand continue to play clean football  throughout and particularly in late-game situations. It sounds like a  stupid clich√©, but they simply don‚Äôt beat themselves, but rather wait  for the opponent to make those mistakes. On their final four  possessions, they scored a field goal and two touchdowns, plus then they  were able to run out the clock, with Saquon making the right decision  for his team to win, as he slid down at the two-yard line instead of  scoring ‚Äì to the chagrin of several fantasy managers of his, like  myself. You can argue right now New York‚Äôs coaching staff is doing as  good a job of maximizing the talent at their disposal as any group in  the league. They play tough, smart old-school football, where they allow  their personnel to dictate what they can run, but then dictate to the  opposing team what they can run in those situations. If there‚Äôs one  thing I‚Äôd like to do them still, it‚Äôs adding a speed-element to that  receiving corp, to open up more space underneath for themselves. I don‚Äôt  want to rule out a ‚Äúhomecoming‚Äù for Odell Beckham Jr.

## Buffalo Bills (5-1) @ Kansas City Chiefs (4-2):

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img j9fq51m35zu91...*

&amp;#x200B;

### Bills O vs. Chiefs D:

The one overarching point for Buffalo‚Äôs offense on Sunday was how  they didn‚Äôt allow Chiefs DC Steve Spagnuolo to dictate the game to them  with a bunch of exotic pressures and forcing Josh Allen to throw it hot.  And they largely did so with multiple tight-ends and/or backs, forcing  Kansas City to match with base personnel. Fullback Reggie Gilliam was on  the field for 29% of snaps on Sunday ‚Äì the highest mark since  their blowout win at the Rams in the season-opener, where they just  closed out the game running the way. Plus, they were in 12 personnel for  seven snaps in this contest, when they have used it just five times all  season heading into the day. That allowed them to create favorable  angles with cross-blocks by the O-line and using the fullback or inserts  by the TEs as lead-blocks, where Devin Singletary is really good at  partially hiding behind that guy in the hole and forcing the defender to  commit to one side, before slicing up the other way. They used some  counter action in the backfield, with the guard wrapping around from the  backside and the RB getting behind him. And once they showed  pin-and-pull run action one way out of an Ace set (with TEs on either  end of the line) and used center Mitch Morse pivoting back the other way  to lead-block for Singletary on a pitch out to the weak-side edge,  which unfortunately was taken off due to a holding call on the wide  receiver to that side, but it was a really cool design and they had the  defense totally fooled. Even taking away Josh as a runner, they ran the  ball the ball 19 times for 93 yards, with Singletary handling all but  two of those.

Something I loved when they were in 21 personnel was being able to  line up in singleback with an Ace Duo set (the FB and TE to the right),  with the Chiefs being in a true 4-3 front, because they were matching  that package, expecting run. Instead, Buffalo ran play-action and had  both the slot receiver away from the strength of the formation off a  scissors concept and the back-side dig wide open, because they faced a  simple cover-three and that second level wasn‚Äôt even close to crowding  those passing windows in any way. Allen showed the maturity to routinely  throw it to Devin Singletary in front of the linebackers (largely off  play-fakes) with the Chiefs playing two-high shells. Understanding what  they were facing from a coverage perspective allowed them to understand  how to create challenges for the defense, along with sprinkling in some  seven-man pass-pro when they needed to block it up in situations, where  they expected Spags to bring pressure. They also had the receivers to  take advantage of those young corners being forced onto the field for  KC, such as Gabe Davis on that 34-yard touchdown just before the half,  running right by his guy on a fade route, having the chemistry with  Stefon Diggs to be in sync on those secondary route adjustments, and  Allen making some bat-shit throws, like when they were pinned inside  their own one-yard line on third-and-13, where the QB dipped underneath  the edge rusher and almost side-armed the ball on a rope to Davis on  sitting down a deep dig, along with multiple sick side-line shots  against a two-deep coverage.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing video qaeotft45zu91...*

&amp;#x200B;

Once again, Kansas City not being able to dictate terms defensively  on many snaps certainly became a big factor. They did end up blitzing on 34.9% of Josh Allen‚Äôs dropbacks, but only pressured him on 11.4% total. It really only was only a factor in third and fourth  downs, where the Bills went five-of-14 on the day. Using the pro  personnel on the offensive side largely put the Chiefs in zone coverage  and they used more sets with three than one (off-ball) linebacker.  That‚Äôs not what we‚Äôre used to from Spaguolo in terms of the  aggressiveness as a play-caller, where early on in this growing rivalry,  they‚Äôd bring pressure spread across all three downs and forced Josh to  throw hot, while having guys in the back-seven, who understand where  that would lead the ball to go to then.

When Spags did have the chance to bring heat in obvious passing  situations against 11 personnel, he was able to scheme open a free  rusher and multiple times peeled off the D-end to take the back, whilst  playing tight man-coverage on the four other eligible receivers. They  had two great back-to-back plays like that at the tail-end of Buffalo‚Äôs  third possession of the day, as they brought Juan Thornhill untouched on  a weak-side B-gap blitz by occupying the five blockers, plus a  linebacker coming through the opposite B-gap, as the right tackle had to  set to the wide end, not expecting him to bail out again. Josh Allen  had to release the ball whilst fading away from the rush on both of  them, once throwing the ball into the stomach of Chris Jones just  playing with his eyes up the whole way, when he had Singletary open on  an angle route, and then putting it slightly behind Isaiah McKenzie on a  quick in-breaker as the number two, where they picked off the slot  defender with Diggs running a corner route. The receiver could have  potentially pulled that one in, if he didn‚Äôt jump, but he had an  extremely rough day altogether.

&amp;#x200B;

### Chiefs O vs. Bills D:

Buffalo certainly showed more of a commitment to running the ball  than Kansas City, as Patrick Mahomes accounted for 21 of their 68  rushing yards on the day ‚Äì all on scrambles ‚Äì and their backs averaged just 3.6 yards a pop. Outside of using a split backfield with their fullback to one side of the quarterback and rolling Mahomes the other  way of a lead play to slow down the pursuit, they didn‚Äôt have many  wrinkles in the ground game, to give them those schematic advantages.  For them it was more so about RPOs and screens to their backs, to make  them a factor, where on the former they used slide routes by Kelce, glances and back-shoulder fade alerts on the outside to give themselves  options. They also had a really fun design on a TE screen to Noah Gray, where they faked a flat screen to the three-receiver side and released  the back wide the other way, with Gray pivoting around underneath that, to get in behind three linemen. If not for Bills LB Tremaine Edmunds being a freak of nature and chasing him down from the backside, he may rip off a huge play on that one.

They are already expected to make a couple billion dollars off of betting agreements. We are seeing more and more absurd calls occurring at increased frequency unlike ever before and it is starting to seem suspicious now that the NFL is itself in cahoots with betting organizations. I believe this could be a reason why instead of modifying roughing the passer the NFL has actually doubled down on the decision to leave it very vague and open for a penalty. If they NFL actually cared about keeping quarterbacks safe and allowing the game to be played QBs would be subject to 2-hand touch or they would wear flags on their hips instead.",NFL is getting suspicious.

Who would of thought the most entertaining part of a Denver Broncos primetime game would be a [Commercial Counter](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/147yAWKBby2T-NUvLqgwoJNtaA1fYG66pUoVgXUHIPx8/edit?usp=sharing)? I count commercials and I track the time and how many non-local commercials there are during the primetime games and post weekly updates!

***NFL COMPARSION STATS***

* We have watched more hours of Denver Broncos Non-Commercial Time in Primetime Games (9) than Broncos have total touchdowns (7).
* There were more non-local commercials in the DEN-LAC game (87) than the Chargers had total rushing yards this week (73).
* The 5-1 Giants have only been in 1 primetime game, where they aired 114 non-local commercials, if we put that in as receiving yards, they would be 5th most for the Giants.
* There were more non-local commercials in the 2nd Half/Overtime in the DEN-LAC game (40) than Russell Wilson had yards in the 2nd Half/Overtime (15).
* Josh Allen has more total yards (2,237) than Total Non-Local Commercials (1,944)

*NOTE: The 51 non-local commercials and 20:23 2nd Quarter was record highs for Commercial Counter History. That being said, find it funny that they ""apologized"" with a season low 2nd Quarter the next game. That 9:33 in the 2nd Quarter is the only time this season to have less than 10 minutes of commercial time in the 2nd Quarter. Also, the 3:36 of WAS vs CHI Halftime Commercial Time had to do with ""The Pile On"" not being a technical commercial, but I really should of counted it.*

* Why do you like commercials so much?  Do you take bathroom breaks when the gameplay starts?  What's your deal man?
   * I don't like them. I just count them. Some of them are cool tho. Yes, and I have taken some during the game. That's how committed I am. Uhhhh. No Deal?
* How did you do this
* Phone Stopwatch, TV, Google Sheets, Doggo. I think it's the doggo.
* Your commercial count for ESPN might be the most different compared to other networks.
   * You are correct though, local commercials, sometimes telecasted to ABC, etc.
* How are you counting? Where do you store these stats?
   * By tracking what shows on my TV?
* what is the average commercial time per game ?

It is the total additional or fewer passing yards a QB earns when comparing each pass attempt at the respective down, distance, and field position to the league average over the last five seasons. Minimum 100 pass attempts .

e.g. If the league average pass attempt on first and 10 at the 50 yard line is 7.5 and a QB throws a pass attempt on 1st and 10 from the 50 that gains 12 yards the QB would earn a +4.5 for the throw.

Let's be honest we're all just going to scroll to our own QBs to see if this chart fits our own narratives.

Again to review this means that Josh Allen's 1980 passing yards is ~405 yard more than the average from the last five seasons when considering down, distance, and filed position while Kyler Murray's 1463 passing yards is ~386 yards fewer than the average from the previous five seasons while considering the down, distance, and field position.

Hello everyone!

We're back for week 6 of Memorability Rankings.

According to some feedback, I'm changing the name of the lowest tier of game from ""not worth watching"" to ""forgettable."" The point of this change is to emphasize that a game doesn't necessarily need to be good to be memorable, as the Broncos have shown time and time again this season.

Thanks for participating.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Criteria

The criteria I came up with is as follows:


##1. **Forgettable**
Essentially, nothing of note in the grand scheme of things happened. Only fans on the winning team will care about this game in 8 months and even they might have already forgotten what happened. A boring game.


##2. **Regular game**
Most games should land in this ranking. Some players had a good statistical performance and there was some good football worth watching. But at the end of the day, it doesn‚Äôt stand out when comparing with other games.


##3. **Memorable game**
This game will be remembered throughout the season with most fans easily being able to recall several plays and moments from the game. It helps if the game has a strong narrative attached to it or if it happened in primetime. The exact same game is more memorable if played in the Divisional Round as opposed to at 1pm EST with Andrew Catalon and Spero Dedes. Games with a crazy finish, huge upsets, and amazing plays. Some examples of games fit for this category:

- Josh Allen hurdles Vikings defenders in huge upset
- Bears ruin Brett Favre night in Lambeau
- Antonio Brown extends at the goal line against the Ravens
- Nick Foles throws 7 touchdowns
- Niners win the division by stopping the Seahawks one yard short
- Colts lose to Jags on clown day to miss the playoffs
- Rodgers throws 2 Hail Marys and Fitzgerald goes crazy in overtime
- Seahawks tie Cardinals 6-6 in wacky game


##4. **Hall of Fame**
A game that will still be brought up in decades. NFL fans will easily remember this game in 10 years. Non-NFL fans might have even heard of this game. You barely need more than 2 words for people to know what game you‚Äôre talking about. Again, if the game happens during the Super Bowl, it‚Äôs more memorable than if it happens in week 4. Some examples:

- 28-3
- Immaculate reception
- DIGGS!
- Helmet Catch
- The Catch
- The Drive
- 13 seconds

Voting ends Friday afternoon.

Herbert has never had even average coaching in his career. He had Lynn and now Staley. He never had an Andy Reid, Sean McVay, Sean Payton, Kyle Shanahan, etc.

248,nfl,"In 2018, the Chiefs and Rams played in one of the greatest NFL games of all time, ending with an insane final score of 54-51.

Every year since, there has always been at least one game that has seen both teams score almost as many points and stand out compared to all other games that year in terms of intensity, just like the Chiefs-Rams game.

In my opinion, the successors of the Chiefs-Rams game from 2019 to 2021 (as 2022 is still ongoing) are:

&amp;#x200B;

2019: The 49ers-Saints game. Both teams were fighting for dominance of the NFC (and the Packers were there too, I guess), and once these two high-flying offenses met it was a bloodbath. The defense was non-existant, but the Saints would've gotten the win were it not for George Kittle's monstrous drive down the field that put the 49er's in field goal range to win the game 49-46, which proved crucial in letting the 49er's get the #1 seed.

&amp;#x200B;

2020: The Browns-Ravens game. Poop jokes aside, this match that initially seemed like Baltimore had it in the bag soon turned into a slobberknocker following Lamar's bowel issues, with both teams' defenses going into the toilets as the Browns crapped out TD's to narrow the score. However, the return of Lamar plus Justin Tucker's OP kicking let them barely win 47-42, despite a wild last-ditch effort by the Browns at the end.

&amp;#x200B;

2021: The Bills-Chiefs NFC Championship. It doesn't get much better than this, and despite the ""low"" score of less than 80 combined points, that doesn't do justice to the intensity and wildness of this match. The fact that a coin decided the winner showed the sheer talent of both Mahomes and Allen, leading to the true start of what will no doubt be one of football's best QB rivalries. 

&amp;#x200B;

So far as of 2022 I can't seem to find any match that fits this due to all the chaos and sloppy performances from usually-good teams.

[Adjusted Games Lost](https://www.footballoutsiders.com/stat-analysis/2022/agl-injury-numbers-point-ravens-rebound-2022) (AGL) is a metric created by Football Outsiders to measure the aggregate impact of injuries on a given team for a given season. They publish new data for the metric every season, so a person with too much free time can use google, inspect element, and an HTML-CSV converter to put all the data in Google Sheets.

I, my friends, am that person with too much free time. This [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1daD7BaSXtAtbk-wdUNunK_JRHcw7WCU_DaFKyi9OsRs/edit?usp=sharing) has the past decade's worth of AGL data. Feel free to play around with it. 

*Note that all credit goes to Football Outsiders; none of this is my intellectual property. I just think it's fun to check up on narratives with numbers.* 

*Also please note that, as a 49ers fan and Rams hater, this research confirms my hypothesis that I want to die. I tried to avoid letting this conclusion bias my analysis.* 

# Quick Facts

**Most-injured season in the past decade**: The **2021-22 Baltimore Ravens**. (In context, an 8-9 record for this team doesn't look too bad, huh?)

**Least-injured season in the past decade:** The **2017-18 Los Angeles Rams**. (This team went 11-5 and lost in the wildcard, wasting a truly remarkable run of health).

**Most-injured teams in the past decade:** Many teams have had bad injury luck for a couple season, but most regress to the mean eventually (around 74 AGL). Looking at the data, there are two major outliers: the **Washington Commies** (avg: \~109 AGL) and the **San Francisco 49ers** (avg: \~102 AGL). No other teams averaged even 92 Adjusted Games Lost over the past decade, making these teams true outliers. In the 49ers' case, recent seasons have dragged that average up (their 2020-21 season was the second-worst in the decade behind only the 2021-22 Ravens, and their 2021-22 season was also pretty terrible). The Redsnyders have been more consistently terrible, with jaw-droppingly bad seasons in 2013-14, 2015-16, 2017-18, and 2019-20. Trent Williams may have made a good decision to escape that medical staff (but a bad one when picking his destination; as a Niners fan, I'm not complaining).

**Least-injured teams in the past decade:** The **Los Angeles Rams** (avg: \~50 AGL) and **Atlanta Falcons** (avg: \~52 AGL) have been exceptionally good at keeping their players healthy; no other teams averaged less than 58 AGL. The Rams healthiness, of course, was punctuated by that 2017-18 season (though they've generally been solid). The Falcons also had a phenomenal 2017-18 season in terms of injuries and have also been generally solid.

It's worth noting that over this fairly large sample size of a decade, injuries don't really ""even out""; the most-injured teams have around TWICE as many games lost as the least-injured teams

# Looking At The Data

This is a graph of the every team's average adjusted games lost over the past decade:

https://preview.redd.it/5rpyq76z51v91.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a03e4be5d90de0c9c179add3680a47df8ed1057

You can see the outliers I pointed out above popping slightly at the left and right sides, with the majority of teams falling between 60-80 Adjusted Games Lost per season.

This is certainly interesting information, but most teams have had a high level of turnover in the last 10 years. Is evaluating a more recent sample more relevant? I have a graph that might help answer that.

**Recency-Weighted Average**

This graph takes an average of all 10 seasons, but weights more recent seasons more heavily. The 2021 season is ""full weight"" (1x), with the 2020 season having a weight of 0.9x, 2019 having a weight of 0.8x, 2018 having a weight of 0.7x, and so on. Is this statistically rigorous? ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø, but it gives you a quick way to see the relative ""injury-proneness"" of teams with an emphasis on recent data. 

https://preview.redd.it/gijowzam71v91.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7126748c6fa9db3bbf9186c51bb85bb20f364ef7

Not much really changes! The Rams and Falcons are still the healthiest teams, and the Commandos and 49ers are still the unhealthiest. One big shift - the **Jets have gotten much worse** injury luck recently, joining the aforementioned teams in the 105+ AGL category.

What if we want to visualize the progression of teams injury frequency over time? Let's take a look at the difference between the recency-weighted and general average to see which teams have gotten better (and worse) at this in recent years:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/z2p63l6691v91.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3dc778d09458a10efe8bd400f3528cf6d938cd3c

On average, the league has gotten slightly worse (the average difference between the weighted and unweighted AGL/season was \~2, which means more recent years have had higher rates of injury). 

Some teams have gotten especially **worse**: the aforementioned **Jets**, of course, along with the **Broncos**, **Eagles**, **Ravens**, and (sigh) **49ers**. 

Teams that have bucked the trend with **better** injury luck recently include the **Bucs**, **Titans**, **Bills**, **Chiefs**, and **Dolphins**; perhaps not coincidentally, these franchises have broadly improved their general reputation over the past decade.

# Takeaways

I have nothing, really. I just wanted to point out some cool free open-access data so I made a post. I really wish the Niners could get their shit together on the medical staff.

268,nfl,"This is a close derivative of the ""never had a losing season"" stat that everyone knows, but it still helps to put that accomplishment into perspective. What this means is, only one of his 15 seasons ended (in terms of playoff contention) before the final week. Here are his 5 non-playoff seasons up to this point:

- **2009**: alive heading into week 17 (albeit barely), won their game, but was eliminated 4 hours later when the Ravens won.

- **2012**: eliminated after a loss to the Bengals in week 16, thus week 17 vs the Browns was meaningless.

- **2013**: the almost-historic playoff comeback where he needed 9 results in the last 2 weeks to break his way to sneak in, and 8 of them did. As is, he was eliminated 4 hours after his last game on a missed Ryan Succop field goal.

- **2018**: the AB blowup season. Yet again he needed to win and the Ravens to lose; he won, the Ravens did not lose, and he was eliminated 20 or so minutes after his final game.

- **2019**: with a platoon of Mason Rudolph and Duck Hodges at QB, he was somehow in a position to sneak into the playoffs in week 17 provided he beats RG3-led Ravens and the Titans lost. Neither happened, so he was eliminated as soon as the whistle blew.

To be fair, this also speaks of how mediocre the middle tier of the AFC was at times - not often does a team that's 7-8 coming into week 17 still has a chance to sneak in.","Another mind-blowing Mike Tomlin stat: in the 15 full seasons he's coached, he's been in exactly one game (out of 239) that was meaningless in terms of the playoff race."

They didn‚Äôt even have to give up a #1 for him.

The Bucs defense is one of the worst situational defenses in the league. 

They absolutely cannot be trusted in a 3rd down situation. Trubisky, who everyone knows is awful was gashing them on four separate occasions of 3rd and 10+ in the 4th quarter alone last week.","This season, the Bucs defense has allowed a conversion on 65% of 3rd and 11+ to go (sample size of 17 plays).

440,nfl,"Nobody does less with more. Now I believe Brady has finally looked a bit washed but still an offense with Brady, Evans, and Godwin are struggling to even get 1st downs and at least 70% of that I believe is due to the one of the most boring, unimaginative offensive playbooks. Even the past 2 years when the offensive talent was insane, almost NOBODY was schemed open. Every single receiver + Gronk had to rely on their athleticism to win their matchups and Brady had to fit in tight windows. This should not happen for an offense with this much talent.

**The Leftwich playbook in 90% of scenarios:**

*1st and 10:* Fournette draw for 2 yards

*2nd and 8:* Hitch for 5 yards or incomplete pass

*3rd down:* Pray for Brady to bail Leftwich out which he did the past two years but not as much this year.

&amp;#x200B;

Look at last week. The Steelers were on their 4th string secondary and what is Leftwich's plan? Try to drive Fournette straight into the Steelers front seven. Evans was targeted only 4 times.

Leftwich as an OC rivals only that of Nathaniel Hackett rn for worst in the business. How any fan can consider him for a HC coach is baffling. If hired, he honestly will be on par with what we've seen with Hackett and likely without a defense as good as the Broncos to back him up.",Byron Leftwich is one of the worst offensive coordinators in all of football

Brady just mentioned he has no plans to retire and I find it hard to think he stays in Tampa much longer. There were whispers even last offseason that Brady unretiring also meant possibly shipped off to the 49ers. 

49ers may have sunk cost with Lance. Brady has always wanted to play for his home area and I wager its either SF or Miami where he'd want to go next. Maybe LV with McDaniels but that's secondary. Miami is keeping Tua meaning SF is the only viable landing spot for the GOAT.

541,nfl,"# Intro:

Like many of you, I was fascinated by Russell Wilson‚Äôs Dangerwich [commercial](https://twitter.com/b_hartland/status/1574860774870228998?s=11&amp;t=p5XSXWC1h-J-KDDkd7MCXQ).  Featuring awkward pauses, fake chewing, and magically reappearing bites of sandwich, the short ad was captivatingly strange.  But what really struck me was how good the Dangerwich looked.  I‚Äôm not usually a sucker for fast food commercials, but I just couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about it.

My fellow Niner faithful may judge me for coveting a sandwich promoted by the monster who destroyed my team‚Äôs hopes and dreams for a decade by frustratingly slipping out of near-certain sacks with a seemingly oiled-up torso and then launching the ball 50 yards down the field.  But my heart wanted what it wanted.  Plus, he‚Äôs a Bronco now, so I should get a pass.

# Subway and I:

Throughout high school and into college, I experienced rather intense anxiety in unfamiliar situations.  One of these unfamiliar situations was ordering from Subway.  The first time I ordered from Subway, I was a high school sophomore.  I was travelling in a school minivan to Fresno with my cross country team on the way to the state championship race when we stopped at a Subway to get lunch.  Uh oh.  I had never ordered from Subway before, and I had no idea what to do.  I placed myself at the back of the line, and as I approached closer and closer to the counter, the more and more nervous I felt.  My turn finally arrived.  There were so many choices.  My eyes darted around scanning all the labels as my mind tried to make sense of it all.  Oh God, everyone was waiting on me and they knew I was cracking.  I quietly mumbled and bumbled my way down the assembly line, but somehow, I came away with a sandwich.  I sat down with my teammates and unwrapped my sub.  It was a six-inch untoasted wheat bread sandwich with ham and nothing else.  My friends gave me grief for my decision, but as I ate my terrible sandwich, I knew that I had survived.

A few years later, I began my Freshman year of college.  My first week, I found myself at the center of campus around lunch time, far away from my room and dining hall.  There was a food court, but all its options were unfamiliar except for Subway.  My hunger drove me towards those green and yellow neon lights, and I once again queued up at the end of the line as I tried to suppress a low but rising panic.  But this time, I listened to how people ahead of me ordered.  Aha, there was a structure to ordering.  Bread, meats, cheese, toasted or not toasted, vegetables.  I mentally prepared for my own sandwich and formulated exactly what I was going to say at each step of the process.  ‚ÄúItalian footlong please.  BMT please.  Swiss please.  Toasted please.  Lettuce, tomato, and cucumber please.  Thank you,‚Äù I repeated in my head, over and over again.  I was now only a few spots away from the counter.  As the Subway Sandwich Artist asked the same series questions to each person ahead of me, I would answer his questions in my head.  By the time I was finally at the front, I was ready.

Mere minutes later, I had successfully ordered my sub.  I walked away from the counter, experiencing a wave of relief followed by embarrassment that this was such a big deal to me.  Nevertheless, as I sat down and bit into my sandwich, I felt a small bit a pride.  I had made a reasonable sandwich.  I did order it without sauce though because I had forgotten to prepare for that step while in line.  In my following years at college, I would often return to that food court Subway, ordering the same sandwich every time, sometimes mentally preparing in line, and always ordering without sauce.

# Procuring the Dangerwich:

On Wednesday, I visited Subway‚Äôs online Vault menu, looking for the Dangerwich Russell had informed me of in secret.  However, to my dismay, it was no longer there.  I sighed and resigned myself to the fact that I had missed my opportunity to taste the Dangerwich‚Äôs daring dangerousness.

The next day I found that I still craved Russell‚Äôs elusive sub, and even more so now that it was the forbidden fruit that Subway was attempting to deprive me of.  I stumbled upon a list of ingredients online and realized I could custom order the Dangerwich myself.  But I didn‚Äôt want to read the ingredients off my phone because that would be embarrassing, and my Subway Sandwich Artist would think I was weird.  So, I decided to memorize the ingredients beforehand and mentally prepare for ordering my sandwich.  Fortunately, this is something I have a lot of experience with.

Before I went to bed that night, I repeated the ingredients to myself aloud until I remembered all of them without fail.  I then visualized the ordering scenario, even moving down an imaginary sandwich assembly line.  ‚ÄúFootlong on Italian herbs and cheese please.‚Äù  Shuffle shuffle.  ‚ÄúPepperoni, salami, and black forest ham please.  Could I also get provolone cheese and add bacon to that?""  Pause.  ""Yes, toasted please.‚Äù  Pause.  Shuffle shuffle.  ‚ÄúCan I get lettuce, tomato, green peppers, and banana peppers please?‚Äù  Shuffle shuffle.  ‚ÄúAnd mayo and yellow mustard please.  Thanks!‚Äù

Rolling out of bed Friday morning, I again listed the ingredients aloud.  And again, as I was shaving.  And again, while preparing a light breakfast.  And again, on the drive to Subway.  And one more time, sitting in my car in the parking lot outside of the Subway.  I walked through the door, excited and ready.

The preparation paid off.  I nailed my lines and hit my marks, and I was rewarded with a custom recreation of Russell Wilson‚Äôs Subway Signature Dangerwich Sandwich.  I sat myself down on a thin 2-chair table by the window, barely wide enough for the footlong wrapper I was unfolding.  And there it was.  The Dangerwich.  The sandwich that I had spent the last few days thinking about and preparing for was right in front of me.  I picked up the right half of the sandwich and paused for a moment, realizing that the Subway‚Äôs indoor speakers were playing ‚ÄúTake My Breath Away.‚Äù  I took a bite.

# The Review:

The predominant flavor of the Dangerwich is the meats, particularly the pepperoni and salami.  Towards the closed edge of the sub, the meats fold onto themselves, so the meat flavor is especially strong there.  Towards the open edge of the sub, you move away from the meats a little and taste a bit more of the banana peppers and the creaminess of the mayo.  While the other vegetables don‚Äôt contribute much to the overall taste due to stronger flavors being at play, they provide a nice crunch.  I alternated bites between the open edge and closed edge, and I preferred the meatier flavor of the closed edge.

Now, you‚Äôre all asking the same question: Was it dangerous?  It certainly wasn‚Äôt dangerously spicy.  I suppose it was mildly spicy, but most of that came from the pepperoni and salami.  Every couple of bites, I took a small sip of my sweet iced tea, which washed away any sensation of spiciness from my tongue.  The banana peppers marginally contributed to the spiciness, but again, the meat did most of the work.  If you consider other types of danger such as choking on unchewed Italian Herb and Cheese bread, then I suppose that would increase the Dangerwich‚Äôs dangerousness, but that doesn‚Äôt seem fair because choking risk isn‚Äôt exclusive to the Dangerwich.

I ate ten of the sub‚Äôs twelve inches.  I was full and fairly satisfied at the end of my meal.  Although, as I got up from my table, I did feel a twinge of disappointment.  The Dangerwich was decent, but when I saw Russell Wilson take multiple first and second bites out of the sandwich in the ad, I imagined something better.  Overall though, when I exited the restaurant, I was glad I did this silly exercise.  I was also glad to see that no one had broken into my car while I was inside.  A pleasant surprise, living in the San Francisco Bay Area.

But what's score do I assign the Dangerwich?  I would like to introduce you to my Infallible 100-point Sandwich Rating Scale (I100PSRS for short).  It considers the ten major aspects of the sandwich consumption experience.  The first five aspects fall into a broad taste category and the other five aspects fall into a general experience category, with each category being worth 50 points.  Points are distributed amongst the ten aspects based on a relative importance.  I‚Äôll provide a blank I100PSRS form in a comment below so that you too can accurately judge the sandwiches you consume.

**Sandwich Aspect Definitions and Point Values:**

* Bread *(5 pts)* ‚Äì Quality of Bread
* Main Fillings *(5 pts)* ‚Äì Quality of Meats/Primary Sandwich Content
* Accessory Fillings *(5 pts)* ‚Äì Quality of Vegetables/Secondary Sandwich Content
* Filling Consistency *(5 pts)* ‚Äì Evenness in which ingredients are spread
* Ingredient Interwork *(30 pts)* ‚Äì How well ingredients complement each other and work together
* Neatness *(10 pts)* ‚Äì Ease in which sandwich can be eaten without making a mess
* Mouth Feel *(15 pts)* ‚Äì Texture, crunch, etc.
* Time to Order *(5 pts)* ‚Äì How long it takes to order the sandwich
* Pre-meal Anticipation *(5 pts)* ‚Äì Level of excitement obtained from smell, looks, etc. before eating
* Post-meal Satisfaction *(15 pts)* ‚Äì Level of fullness and general happiness after eating

The below table contains my scoring for the Dangerwich.  For comparison, I included the Italian BMT I used to order in college and a McDonald‚Äôs Double Quarter Pounder with Cheese.  Due to the importance of dangerousness in this particular sandwich discussion, I added a special ‚ÄúDanger Bonus‚Äù worth up to five points.

|Sandwich Aspect|Dangerwich|College BMT|Dbl Qrt Pd w/ Cheese|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Bread (5 pts)|4|4|3|
|Main Fillings (5 pts)|4|4|5|
|Accessory Fill. (5 pts)|5|4|3|
|Filling Consist. (5 pts)|3|4|5|
|Ing. Interwork (30 pts)|19|17|25|
|Neatness (10 pts)|8|7|7|
|Mouth Feel (15 pts)|12|11|9|
|Time to Order (5 pts)|5|5|3|
|Pre-meal Ant. (5 pts)|5|4|3|
|Post-meal Sat. (15 pts)|9|8|14|
|Danger Bonus (+5 pts)|2|1|5 (Heart attack risk)|
|**Total**|76/100|70/100|82/100|

And there it is.  Through the Infallible 100-point Sandwich Rating Scale, I have awarded the Dangerwich **76 points** out of a possible 100.  It is better that the sandwich I typically get at Subway, but it is certainly not the best fast-food sandwich available.

## Graphs

[Here are the week's and season's results in graph form](https://imgur.com/a/wsp98f8)

The Raiders are still the most memorable team so far, having played two memorable games (both losses) and no forgettable games. The Dolphins, Chiefs, and Bills have played 2 memorable games as well.

The Panthers are the least memorable team, and they'll probably fade further into obscurity after trading Christian McCaffrey.

The AFC South and the NFC East are the least memorable divisions but for different reasons.

## Memorable Games


### Bills @ Chiefs

Is it too early to call the Mahomes-Allen rivalry the new Brady-Manning?

It seems the Bills and Chiefs are here to stay as perennial AFC powerhouses, and it helps that the last few times these teams have played they've always delivered a good game. CBS even pulled the rare move of showing this game to the entire country even though it was a 4:25 EST kickoff. If you like football, you were probably watching this game.

As for the game itself, it wasn't a ridiculous shootout like when these teams met in the AFC Divisional Round last year, but it was still very compelling Tony Romo was able to accurately predict the final score. Both offenses were able to move the ball in good chunks, like they've become accustomed to, but both QBs made crucial turnovers inside field goal range in the first half.

Amazingly, the Chiefs one-uped their famous 13-second FG-drive with 2 timeouts by scoring on a 12-second FG-drive with 1 timeout to close out the first half. It seems like McDermott cannot figure out what to do in that situation.

Nevertheless, Josh Allen and the Bills prevailed, after Allen hurdled a Chiefs defender and leading the bills to the go-ahead score, the great Bills pass defese was able to intercept Mahomes with less than a minute left to play, sealing the Bills' win.

This game will very likely have seeding implications for the AFC playoffs.

608,nfl,,[Set the Edge] How to Steal Millions From Those Who Need it Most: The Brett Favre Playbook
609,nfl,"Coming into training camp, like every season there were positive vibes and high hopes by folks in the Giants, Panthers, and Cowboys training camps about their star running backs health and outlook going forward. We had reason to be concerned about **E.Elliot**, **S.Barkley** and **C.McCaffrey** given their declines relative to their early career peaks.   

Going into the season I **analyzed the likelihood that these running backs would make it back (or reasonably close) to their peak years when they were at the top of the league.** My analysis wasn't based on each of the players specific situation, injury type, reason for decline, and outlook (I'm not that smart), it was simply a look back at all running backs who have experienced a similar statistical pattern as these three and what happened to those guys; young stars, followed by a decline earlier than expected based on their age.. 

**My criteria** 

* RB making the pro bowl before age 26 since 1978 (N = 107)
* Then I narrowed this list down by players who had a clear decline in production (injury-related or not). This took the sample size down to 35 (out of the 107)

Then I looked at what happened next and **categorized their remaining years into three categories**: a *bounce back* (at or close to their early pro bowl production), or the decline was truly the beginning of a continued *gradual decline,* or they *dropped off a cliff.* 

I also hypothesized that early draft picks would have a higher rate of bouncing back, because teams are more vested in their success and are more willing to stick with that player. The results confirmed that was the case. A team is more likely to keep trying to force a top ten pick like George Rogers to play well, than they are to stick with later round picks like Barry Foster or Rueben Mayes after a decline. 

**Overall, 31% of running backs who have a somewhat similar criteria to McCaffrey, Barkley and Elliot returned close to their early dominance for a sustained period of time. But if they were a top 10 draft pick like these three guys, they came back 71% of the time.** 

https://preview.redd.it/jbncanqqlcv91.png?width=1007&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1acc77e5ea4f256fd6fb17c8f0fc3ad20ec85a00

* Examples of guys who fit the criteria of a full bounce back: *Edgerrin James, Steven Jackson, Jerome Bettis*. 
* Examples of a continued gradual decline: *Natrone Means, Devonta Freeman, Jordan Howard*.
* Examples of an abrupt end to their career: *Jay Ajayi, Eddie Lacy, Barry Foster*.

**Caveats galore**: This is **highly subjective**. There was no formula to determine ""*bounce back*"" or ""*gradual decline*"". I **eyeballed their performance** (mostly yards from scrimmage) and made the determination. Same with the decline in production for the group of 35 decliners out of 107 running backs who made the pro bowl before age 25. My criteria for early success (pro bowl by age 25) and a decline at or before their prime (age 26 or younger) are **arbitrary**, but I thought it was a sensible way to do this. And of course, we have some real **sample size issues** in this data.

1. Herbert

2. Burrow

3. Hurts

4. Tua (probably?)

The QB is not all-in. And as a result of the QB's antics, Todd Bowles and the players get constant questions about the QB. It creates an environment where the reporters find it acceptable to ask the Head Coach about seeking help from the former Head Coach.

Obviously, it gets better as the season progresses, but even at this point, through most of week 7, I think it's already pretty good, and in many ways (perhaps not completely though, after all this method is uber simplistic), better than the rank lists that NFL.com or /r/nfl put out.  Here's how it plays out currently for this season, from #1 best team, to the worst:

Team		Net Pts
Bills			95
Eagles		56
Chiefs		51
Bengals		41
Cowboys		30
Patriots		28
Jets			22
Vikings		21
Giants		20
Ravens		20
Jaguars		18
Raiders		13
49ers		12
Buccaneers	0
Seahawks		-3
Falcons		-8
Titans		-13
Broncos		-15
Dolphins		-18
Packers		-18
Browns		-18
Cardinals		-20

Chargers		-25
Bears		-25
Panthers		-25
Saints		-25
Colts			-27
Commanders	-31
Texans		-31
Lions			-48
Steelers		-55

Another way to use this stat might be to come up with favorites point differentials.  For instance, next week, Steelers will play the eagles.  Total pt differential = 111.  Over 7 games, so the expected spread might be 111/7 = 15.8, or, Eagles favored by just over 2 touchdowns.

Zach Wilson. He‚Äôs averaging 0.25 passing touchdowns a game while throwing for only 175 yards a game. He again has more interceptions than TDs. Why aren‚Äôt the Jets throwing a ton this year? The reason? Because Zach Wilson will hurt them not help them.

And fans are finally getting a taste of what Daniel Jones can do at QB. This must be what the ownership and prior general manager saw when they took Jones with the sixth overall pick in the 2019 draft. They saw the successor to Eli Manning.

We all know what happened in the years that followed. Heading into this year, the new regime declined to pick up the option on Jones‚Äôs contract for 2023. Who could blame them for giving pause? But now that decision is looking more costly every week, Andrew Beaton writes.

*‚ÄúEvery week of this season, that decision is looking costlier and costlier. But the Giants aren‚Äôt exactly upset about it. That‚Äôs because Jones is leading the NFL‚Äôs most shocking run of the year.*

*The Giants are 6-1 after yet another win, this time a 23-17 triumph over the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday. This one may have been Jones‚Äôs most impressive yet: He threw for more than 200 yards and ran for over 100‚Äîjust the 29th such performance in the Super Bowl era.*

*It was a taste of what once made Jones an intriguing prospect. He can throw. He can run. And now he can go and get paid.*

One of the biggest contributors to this turnaround season has been the growth of Jones under center. And now the Giants have decisions to make. Beaton writes:

*How Jones plays over the rest of this season, and whether he keeps this up, could have enormous financial implications for him and the Giants. They could still retain him with the franchise tag, a one year deal that for quarterbacks last year cost nearly $30 million and is expected to rise next season. The alternative, if they want to keep him, would be trying to lock him up with a longer deal‚Äîan increasingly expensive proposition in the modern NFL.*

If you were the GM this offseason, what would you do?

973,nfl,,[Highlights] Pickett‚Äôs 3rd INT seals the game
974,nfl,,[Bellinger] Wow! (Devin Lloyd poking Daniel Bellinger‚Äôs eye)
975,nfl,"Before 1990 there were 2 Wild Card teams but they played each other in the first round so they could not meet in a conference championship. Since 1990 there have either been 2 or 3 Wild Card teams on opposite ends of the bracket who could meet for a conference championship, but they never have. Only 8 Wild Card teams have made the Super Bowl since 1990 and all of them beat a division winner to win their conference championship. Thought it was interesting since a Wild Card vs. Wild Card LCS happened in baseball this year, the first year it was possible.","Since 1990, it has been possible for two Wild Card teams to play each other in a conference championship game. However, a Wild Card vs. Wild Card conference championship has never happened."

977,nfl,,"'No one feels good about where we‚Äôre at': Tom Brady, Buccaneers fall to Panthers, drop to 3-4"
978,nfl,It‚Äôd speed up the game and allow for more less boring plays. It would also force teams to get more creative when they‚Äôre trying to burn the clock and kneeling wouldn‚Äôt count for as much time. Curious other peoples thoughts,If a play results in a run for 5 yards or less there should only be a 20 second play clock

985,nfl,"The front office said this wasn't a rebuild and they were instead ""retooling"" and expecting a quick turnaround.

Dan Campbell, with a worse start than Patricia had, is not trending in the right direction.

It's clear the MCDC experiment is a failure. Rip the bandaid off and fire him after the season is over.

Go big for a proven successful coach like Sean Payton or Jim Harbaugh.

Draft Will Anderson at number 1 overall. Draft Anthony Richardson at 16 with the Rams pick, let him sit for a year under Goff and learn from his HoF coach who used to be a QB.

Actual timeline: keep Dan Campbell another year because the Ford family is cheap and we're dumb enough to sign him to a 6-year contract.","Over the first 23 games in their HC career: Matt Patricia (9-13-1), Dan Campbell (4-18-1)"

988,nfl,"I've been thinking - it appears that, in fact, the Seahawks have a better offense than expected, and the Broncos have a worse offense than expected.
