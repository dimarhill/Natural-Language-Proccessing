they lost last night giving up 34pts to Ja Morant 

they won last year against the Celtics but gave up 46 pts to Jaylen Brown who now has his own record of 30+ points in consecutive season openers, which he certainly can thank the Knicks for LOL

It's pretty interesting seeing the actual discrepancy with Randle and a PG. I think Randle is a solid player but he plays with a lot of emotion. When things aren't going his way, you often see him lose his cool and start barreling into the lane and making stupid defensive plays. This past season was the first time in front of full stadiums and with much, much more media coverage (even for NY) because they over performed the year before. They tried to run the offense through him and play Burks/Fournier in the backcourt to add shooting but those two, RJ, Mitch are a bunch of guys who aren't equipped to be #2, and Julius isn't equipped to be #1 which made things worse. This is why the Knicks paid Brunson, a guy who can hold the ball and be consistent unlike their guards of the past.

Hopefully Randle can go back his 20/21 form. I think him, RJ, and Brunson can be solid 2/3/4 options with a bunch of prospects projecting to be very good role players.

48,nba,"I remember in my high school tennis team, teams had to decide who would play 1st singles, 2nd singles, 3rd singles, etc. 1st singles was supposed to be your best guy, 2nd singles was your 2nd best, etc.  It was illegal to ""stack"" your lineup, which is where you put your worst guys at 1st and 2nd singles and start playing your best guys at number 3, 4, 5, etc. The reason this is tempting is that if your team is worse at every position, you'd be expected to lose every match. But if you stack your lineup, you can have your 1st guy and 2nd guys pummeling their 3rd or 4th guys and then you have a better chance at winning more matches and pulling off the upset.

To compare, **LeBron James** since coming into the league played all **82** games in a season only once and played 80+ games in 3 of them. This isn't a knock on LBJ, but it shows the difference in eras, how stars in the early 2000s would start to sit out games more often due to minor injuries or would just sit them out to load manage and preserve health for the Playoffs.

MJ's 80-81 games: **1988-89** (81 games), **1991-92** (80 games)

The more I look at his stats, the more I scratch my head, wondering how he was able to sustain such a high level of basketball for so long. Minutes per game was the crazy one. He averaged **40+** in 3 seasons and **39+** in 6. The man was a machine.

**LeBron James** was the same early in his career, averaging **40+** in 4 consecutive seasons, then hitting **39+** once and then dropped lower and lower because his team was just better constructed overall, so he didn't need to play as much.","In Michael Jordan's 15 seasons in the NBA, he played all 82 games in 9 and 80+ in 11 of them!"

135,nba,"So I‚Äôm a cavs fan‚Ä¶and the opinion I‚Äôm about to give would pretty much get me banned on the Cavs sub‚Ä¶which is a sad state of affairs‚Ä¶but anyways ‚Ä¶here it is 

This dude has extreme limitations offensively. I watched all of his games last year and I attributed it to age and lack of experience. But the more I watch- the more I notice a complete lack of body control, awful ball handling ( like really really bad), he is not a good shooter and lacks aggression. 

That said- he does have a great frame, seems to be of high character and I think I read about him having a solid work ethic. Furthermore, he‚Äôs a very good defender. 

But I wanted to ask a more objective fan base. Many cavs fans consider him a franchise cornerstone future top 10 player. I don‚Äôt even think there‚Äôs a 2% chance of this.  I see his ceiling as a 16-18 ppg- 8 rebounds- 1.5-2 bpg. This is a solid player for sure‚Ä¶but I‚Äôm not seeing anything special. Thoughts?",Mobley and my honest thoughts

Not to mention Simmons was healthy during the 2021 offseason and most of the 2021/2022 season before he had a back injury while ramping up with the Nets. There were reports of him playing pick up games around Philly while holding out and looking great there, practicing with local college teams.

144,nba,"In a highly unlikely event that Lakers will somehow finish in top 3, I do think Lebron James can get away with MVP. Here is why:


1) He is protected to break Kareem's once unreachable record. MVP needs naratives, and t will make him seem better than he actually would be in the eyes of the media. 

2) He just effortlessly put 34/12/8 which could ƒèeasily be 34/12/12 if they have anyone that can make threes. He can average a slightly stat padding triple double at age 38 if he wants to. Fair or not, his longevity and age will be the second narrative. 

3).Perception of the Lakers. Right now, they are a team that is poorly constructed. 10 player from last years team is still unsigned. They couldn't even make the playoff. If they make a trade for Cavs 2018 like roster with shooting and zero defence other than AD, they will have enough fire power having the most efficent play in NBA with AD/Lebron PnR surrounded by 3 shooters. In this scenario, they can get into first 3 in the conference as it will constitute a great regular season team. So, he will be seen as the one who turned it around. 

4) Legacy Games. He is just good at that, like just before the bubble season when he shut down Kawhi and Giannis at back to back games. He is gonna pick and choose, if he wants the MVP. 

So what about the front runners?  

1).Luka has the 2 and 4 down and a better team around him. But if Lebron would break the record and have the same or better averages in a subpar team, he will have the narrative. I think that Luka is better, at this stage, than Lebron, and clear favourite for the MVP, he just doesn't have the narrative. 

2) Jokic - Best player in the NBA with Giannis, but voter fatigue. 

3) Embiid - If he stays healthy, the fact that he lost last year and Jokic is out of the race will help his narrative. It is weird to award someone this years MVP for something that happened last year, but this is how it happens in NBA. It will depend on if the voters value defence or faciliating more. He won't have any historical breakthroughs like Lebron will, and his counting stats may lower with a healthy, iso Harden back in the game. But this is a though one, because there is a huge chance that they will be the first in the Eastern Conference. 

4) Giannis. He is the best player in NBA, probably the Defensive Player of the year every season.  He will have the same handicups as others.

I think voters will favour Lebron breaking Kareems record and playing at such a high level at 38 over unhumanly, but excepted performance from others. 

If Lakers somehow sneak into top three, and no other stars has a breakthrough (Luka coming in shape, averaging triple, finishing first etc), Lebron is gonna be in the MVP race, and one or two games in his favour (Remember 2008 when Lakers beat Hornest at the penultimate game of the season which net Kobe the MVP) I think he is gonna win it. 

One thing to consider: This roster is not gonne win the chip, and I think LeBron is very aware of that. So it could be the only season since 2013 that he focuses on Regular Season to break Kareems record. 

What do you think? Could he be in the MVP race? Does it make sense to use Longevity and Historic Records when evaluation the regular season? And above all, will he care enough to wore himself down?",MVP Dark Horse: LeBron James

Shaedon Sharpe was really efficient tonight. 12 points on 6 shots and 3-3 from 3. and Jabari Smith was kind of the opposite and couldn't find his shot, 3-6 from inside the arc and 3-11 from outside.

Not much more to say, just surprised at how NBA ready almost all of these guys looked. Orlando and Detroit was a great game to watch. Paolo, Ivey and Duren all looked incredibly comfortable out there. Maybe it's because it's young team vs young team. But as a stones fan I'm hoping I can see more of Duren impacting how the other team navigates the paint like that.","The Rookies From This Lottery Class Showed Out For Their NBA Debuts Today.

Alot has been made of Lebron and how he is all but guaranteed to break Kareems all-time scoring record this season and how he has the best longevity of all time.

And rightfully so, what Lebron has and will accomplish is at minimum one of the 2 greatest careers in NBA history. However, Kareem at age 30 had 18,638 points, this means Kareem had 19749 AFTER HE TURNED 30.

At 35 Kareem had 28,028 so he still had over 10,000 points left in his career.

&amp;#x200B;

If Kareem had been able to come out of high school directly into the NBA at 18 like other all time greats such as Lebron, Kobe or KG instead of at 22 when he was the greatest college player of all time his total point record would likely be over 40,000.",Kareems longevity

**Background**

When people think about Bill Russell's legacy, it always goes back to winning 11 championships, a feat so incredible it matches up with any of Wilt's ridiculous records. Yet while people acknowledge the greatness involved with that much winning, they also have a lot of doubts about how much of the 60's Celtics dynasty can be attributed to Bill Russell as an individual talent, and how much is on the back of how great his supporting cast and coaching was. You can see this whenever a thread about Bill Russell pops up on here; yes, he won eleven, but he was supposed to win that much. The Celtics were just that much better than everyone else.

However, 1968-69 is the year no one can dare to make that claim. Sam Jones, the second best scoring guard of the 60's and offensive punch to Russell's defensive grip, was 35 and on his last legs. Hall of Famers of Celtics' past like Tom Heinsohn, Frank Ramsey, and K.C Jones had retired. And Russell himself was 34, clinically diagnosed with exhaustion from the added wear and tear of being both a starting player and the team's coach. He was also battling a knee injury for most of the season, which had put him in the hospital and kept him out for a number of games.

On a personal level, Russell was struggling with his marriage to his first wife. He had also become more disillusioned by the corruption found in the country he lived in due to events like the assassination of Robert Kennedy, and felt he was wasting his time by playing something as trivial as basketball. He was 15 pounds overweight going into the season, and missed multiple mandatory NBA coaches meeting due to a lack of motivation. This, along with the age and bodily fatigue, lead him to privately inform Celtics GM and long time friend Red Auerbach that this was to be his *last season, win or lose*. 

**Celtics Season**

The Celtics finished 48-34, the worst record of Russell's career. They barely squeaked into the playoffs, finishing 4th in the East, and the teams that finished in front of them (Bullets, 76ers, Knicks) were 57, 55 and 54 win teams respectively. Whoever made it out of the East was expected to face the newly assembled Lakers superteam comprised of Wilt, West and Elgin Baylor. No one in the media gave any real favor or attention to Russell and the aging Boston Celtics. 

In one of the greatest playoff runs in NBA history, the Celtics ran through the 2nd seed Sixers in 5 games, and then beat the Knicks, lead by Willis Reed and Walt Frazier, in 6. The Celtics won the final Game 6 by a single point, and in that game Russell put up *12/21/5 on 60 FG%*. For the whole series, Russell averaged *16.3/20.8/5.2 on 48 FG%*, up from his regular season averages of *9.9/19.3/4.9 on 43 FG%*. 

**1969 NBA Finals**

In the Finals, the Celtics were up against a Lakers team favored 3 to 1 to win. Since Russell had joined the Celtics, the Lakers had gone 0-7 to them in Finals matchups. A motivated Jerry West and Elgin Baylor were desperate for revenge, and hungry to give the city of Los Angeles its first title. 

This would be also be Russell's final matchup against the Big Dipper, Wilt Chamberlain. Wilt had suffered an embarrassing loss to the Celtics the year before, in which his 76ers had, for the first time in NBA history, blown a 3-1 lead in the playoffs. Finding himself in a situation where he had far better talent around him than Russell's, and still in the twilight of his prime coming off of his 3rd consecutive MVP season, Wilt was also confident that he could deliver Russell the third playoffs loss of his career. 

The Celtics went down 2-0 immediately, getting torched by Jerry West who dropped 53 and 41 in Games 1 and 2. The Celtics came back with a 111-105 victory in Game 3. In Game 4, the Lakers were on the cusp of going up 3-1, leading the game by 1 point with 7 seconds left on the clock. Sam Jones then made a last second buzzer beater which bounced straight up off the rim and into the basket, tying up the series. Game 5 the Lakers solidly won 117-104 behind West's 39 points. The Celtics barely held on in Game 6 at home, winning 99-90 and bringing the series to a Game 7 in Los Angeles. 

Before Game 7, Lakers management were so confident that owner Jack Kent Cooke ordered thousands of balloons be hung up from the ceiling with the words ""World Champion Lakers"" printed on them, which would then be released after the imminent Lakers win. Not only that, but flyers were placed in every seat stating, ‚ÄúWhen, not if, the Lakers win the title, balloons will be released from the rafters, the USC marching band will play ‚ÄúHappy Days Are Here Again.""""

When the Celtics caught word of what was going on, Bill Russell simply said to Jerry West, *""Those fucking balloons are staying up there.""*

The Celtics won a nailbiter Game 7 with a final score of 108-106, despite Jerry West going nuclear and putting up 42/13/12. Russell had won the first finals in the NBA history from down 0-2, and completed arguably the greatest underdog playoff run the game has seen. Here's an [ecstatic Bill Russell after the game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksE7N78a9ds), now with more rings than fingers, ready to retire from the NBA as a champion once again. Russell in the series with the Lakers averaged *9.1/21.1/5.1*. While John Havlicek was the undeniable star of the Celtics (26/9/5), Russell still anchored the Celtics defense as well as he ever did, and *lead his team in assists through the series* because of the team's lack of a quality point guard. 

**Conclusion**

1969 is probably the biggest year of Bill Russell's career in terms of defining his greatness. This was a year where the odds were clearly stacked against him, facing teams clearly favored and better than his. Personal issues, age, and health issues plagued him and the Celtics throughout the season. They barely even made it into the playoffs! And despite everything, Russell still did what he did for his entire career: made his teammates better, and ended up the winner. 

In his final season, Russell also made All-NBA All Defensive First Team, finished 4th in MVP voting, and lead his team to one last banner. The following year after he retired, the Celtics would go 34-48 and miss the playoffs.",1969: Bill Russell's Miracle Last Season

259,nba,"If Lebron or KD in a 3 year stretch won two mvps, a defensive player of the year, a championship and a finals mvp. And in the closing game of winning the championship put up 50 points.

It‚Äôs one of the greatest 3 year stretches of all time.

So no, KD is not the best player in the world like some people are saying. Because if Kd or Lebron did what Giannis did from 2019-2021, everyone would say they‚Äôre the best in the league. I‚Äôm just being completely equal and fair here.

But his defense held him back. In his sophomore season Zion was one of the worst defenders in the league. I remember him getting repeatedly cooked by Georges Niang and other role players. 

Seems like so far this isn't the case? In preseason and the opener Zion looked decent on that end. Granted his primary assignment was noted offensive liability Ben Simmons, but he had some solid help and positioning to help him snag four steals. He bottled up Kyrie on a few possessions as well. 

There were some possessions where he was a bit lazy. The effort still isn't entirely there, possibly because Zion's still getting accustomed to NBA basketball after a long break. But it seems like he's made the jump from a total sieve to average. What are your thoughts on Zion's defense so far?",What are your thoughts on Zion's defense?

358,nba,"Rules are simple, unleash your inner hater and let the world know who and why you hate in the league the most. It‚Äôs all good and noble to be a fan of a player because of some silly reason like ‚Äúthey are good at basketball‚Äù, but it‚Äôs way more fun to hate on players. 

Some guidelines are that you should explain why you hate a certain players game or personality in particular. Just because they always go off against your team is a weak reason.

Additionally, just like when building a real team, better players should take preference.    For example, hating nniang because he bricks threes in the playoffs is pretty weak hating. 

Without further ado, here‚Äôs mine: 

1. Kevin Durant 

This one is pretty simple, he gives me taking the ball home when he‚Äôs losing vibes.  Joining the warriors just seems like an all time loser move that caused me to stop watching basketball from 2017-2020. It‚Äôs crazy how a competitive league makes for a better product, and I blame KD for how sad the nba was for a time. 

2. Kyrie Irving

Another simple one, I hate not being able to just sit back and enjoy one of the more entertaining players in the league play basketball without thinking about how he‚Äôs a colossal dumbass and a negative to society. Also pure isoball without a playmaker next to kyrie just feels like a losing formula. I.e Devin booker without chris paul

3. James Harden + 4. Joel Embiid 

I lumped these two together because my beef with them is basically the same. Two of the most skilled and exciting players to watch‚Ä¶.when they aren‚Äôt foul baiting. Except for the fact that they ARE always foul baiting. It makes 76ers basketball unwatchable to me. I get it, it‚Äôs a skill and it helps their teams win, but it‚Äôs not a skill I respect or find entertaining like stephs shooting or lebrons passing. Also both players have a huge victim complex ( shoutout James Harden for posting his stats on Twitter with the captain ‚Äústay humble‚Äù, that was great lol)

5. Draymond Green

Love what he brings on the court as a basketball player, but he‚Äôs downright annoying. The dirty plays, the way he talks like he would be relevant if he wasn‚Äôt on the warriors, making a documentary about punching his teammate??? Idk just not a likeable guy. 

Honorable mentions:

I don‚Äôt get why the lakers won‚Äôt put him on the bench.  If he comes out and scores 13 with a couple assists great.  If he‚Äôs doing stupid shit like he‚Äôs known todo. Good. He‚Äôs only able to hinder the team for a limited time.

But now I‚Äôm seeing more and more people defend him.  I don‚Äôt know how you can watch him play. And every play there‚Äôs a 30% chance the ball is going to hit the shot clock or be launched into the third row.  And say, ‚Äúyeah but he‚Äôs being scapegoated‚Äù. Dog he‚Äôs the 3 in the lakers big 3.  The teams trash outside of them.

The only other person who can be blamed is AD. Bro is hurt constantly. Also shooting 12% from 3 is horrible.  But guess what. AD is there best defender by far and offered something.  What does Westbrook offer? Inefficient scoring. Inefficient playmaking. And mid defense at best.  So yeah. He‚Äôs going to be blamed. The other 2 guys do so much more for the team. Westbrook on a routinely bases is a negative to the team in almost every aspect. Why are we defending a dude making 47 million to be out preformed by John Wall who hasn‚Äôt played in 567 days and was on the verge of being retired.",Criticism towards Westbrook is deserved

631,nba,"INFORMATION:      
Back when Houston traded Harden at the start of the 2020-2021 season, they focused on a pick-centric return due to their obligations from the CP3-Westbrook trade, something that received a lot of criticism at the time.  (A Top-4 protected double swap in 2021, top-4 protected picks in 2024/2026, and a top-10 protected swap in 2025.)  Houston grabbed every unprotected swap and pick they could get from Brooklyn, and even leaned so hard into the idea that they converted Jarrett Allen into a Bucks pick that's conveying this year, unprotected. 

Fast forward after the Nets traded Harden to Brooklyn, they've ended up with the Sixers pick this year and a top-8 protected pick two years after the first to OKC for dumping Al Horford.
              
PREMISE:         
 If I'm the Nets, I might trade both Sixers picks to add lottery protections to whatever I still owe Houston. The KD trade demand showed the organization how perilous their position could quickly become and securing lottery protections on whatever still owed would lessen the potential fallout. For their part, instead of waiting around for a Nets pick to land high while potentially risking a pair of 5th overall picks in 3 years to OKC, the team could add a high-powered prospect to their growing list of young and exciting players.","If the Sixers are bad enough, could the Nets trade the pick to the Rockets for pick protections?"

742,nba,"In NBA debates the argument for the greatest player of all time usually comes down to Michael Jordan and LeBron James, and the default third place pic is usually Kareem Abdul-Jabbar with some even saying he belongs in the conversation for greatest player of all time.


I believe that to be incorrect, he did not have the statistical dominance of Wilt Chamberlain he didn't have the dominant winning like Bill Russell, he doesn't have the overall combination of the two combined with peak like Michael Jordan, and what was his greatest asset which is longevity has already been surpassed by LeBron James considering how well LeBron is playing at this stage of his career compared to where Kareem was his last four years



Kareems peak was the 1970s which was an era overrun with cokeheads, a lot of the best players in basketball were in the ABA, there certainly was no dominant team that just stopped everybody else from winning, and he came out of that decade with only one championship, five MVPs yes ( but one of those he missed the playoffs so I think it's fair to say the MVP voting might have been a little sketchy with the players voting even though I would still say he deserved most of them)



And even when he started winning in the 80s it was because he had the greatest point guard of all time by his side, and I get that they needed each other but this was not a Jordan and Pippen situation, those Lakers teams were Magics right away, from Game 6 of those finals onward people will say Magic stole the 1980 Finals MVP but I would say Kareem stole the 85 Finals MVP from Magic so it evens out



Not to mention the idea of him being the automatic number three or consensus goat before Jordan was never consensus, I know it's only one publication but here is slam magazines top 75 list released in 2003

747,nba," our games with Boston over the last few years have always been extremely entertaining and exciting. Always extremely close and we both play the same way. If both these teams ever met in a 7 game series I would have died of a heart attack by game 4. All of them since 2019-2020 would be fun to rewatch. 

I‚Äôm sure people feel similarly with their team and a certain opponent. Not necessarily rivals or anything. Just always close games. So who‚Äôs that team for you I guess is another way to ask this?",Which two teams always have entertaining match ups together?

749,nba,"In my lifetime, I have never seen the sentiment on a professional athlete sour the way that it has for Russell Westbrook. To go from (semi)respected and revered to a pariah within a 1-1.5 seasons is remarkable, especially considering it is MOSTLY due to his play and production. It is obvious this is almost CERTAINLY due to the fit and roster construction (Pelinka, WTH?) but wow, has this roster exposed and accentuated the flaws in Westbrooks' game. 

It is the perfect storm: the LA market is covered excessively, he has a bloated $44.2m contract on a losing team that includes Lebron James and Anthony Davis, poor production/performance, and Westbrook is a stubborn player resistant to adapting his role/style of play to what the team needs. To top it all off, he does himself no favors with how he interfaces with the media.

He could potentially go from being named to the 75th anniversary team to being out of the league within 2 seasons",Is there precedent for the Westbrook saga?

754,nba,"Russell Westbrook changed his game more than anyone to adapt to playing with LeBron. He also bore the brunt of LeBron's frustrations during his Lakers tenure with indirect jabs and rumors of trades involving Love.

This is a summary of how Brian Windhorst described it on The Lowe Post:

Kyrie Irving ""opted out of what Westbrook is dealing with,"" Windhorst said. ""Westbrick deals with the persecution of being a LeBron teammate, of being blamed, of dealing with his social-media undercutting, of being the fall guy, as he's called himself.""

He added: ""There have been so many days and nights where Russell Westbrook has walked out of a building feeling beleaguered or beaten down either directly because of LeBron"" or indirectly.

But Windhorst says Westbrook insists that it's all worth it because playing with James also means playing late into the lottery and competing for play-in championships.

""I have to give Russ a real major hat tip for being a professional and being an adult about it,"" Windhorst said. ""He has always seen the big picture ... He has always maintained that this is all worth it, that playing in these late games ‚Äî I mean, this is a guy who played for six years, whatever it was, never sniffed the playoffs. He's like: 'This is where I'm at right now. This is the charge for playing with [James].'""

For fuck's sake, Westbrook literally developed anxiety and stress to the point of having panic attacks and you have to think some of that was due to the pressure of playing with LeBron.

Despite all that LeBron to the very end never seemed to appreciate what Love went through for him. When he signed with the Lakers, Russ found out from a notification and HE called LeBron to tell him he loved him.

Man, I just really admire Russell Westbrook and his strength and big heart in the face of what he puts up with.","Not enough is made of the fact that LeBron got Russell Westbrook to join him in Los Angeles and commit long-term, but then LeBron himself didn't commit long-term and routinely undercut Westbrook in one way or another. And through all that Westbrook never complained once and appreciated everything"

The guy with the rings was 70+ years old, about 6'2"", in amazing shape, and says he played college ball at University of Oregon. The party was in the Palm Springs area. This guy definitely knows his basketball as we talked about hoops for at least 15 minutes. Most people at this party were fairly wealthy, so I believe he'd have the money to buy the rings. 

I held the rings and they were heavy, and definitely not plastic. I've been trying to research what those rings looked like and what happened to them, but haven't found anything conclusive yet. One of them clearly said KOBE on on the top and BRYANT on the bottom, which I've circled in a screenshot at the link above. Apologies for the blurry images, there was an open bar at the party...

I'll spare the overly long intro from the first time and give this abbreviated version- starting in 1960, this series looks to go through the history of the NBA and revote on the hall of fame classes, while adopting the rules from baseball's hall of fame. (10 years on the ballot, 75%+ for induction, less than 5% and you're off.) Every voter is free to apply their own standards- you can care about or disregard character, college accomplishments or international ones. I'll provide very very limited summaries of player's accomplishments if you decide you want to read through it... or not! Most of us aren't super familiar with the 50's/60's game. If you want to read my ramblings in a little more detail, [here's the link to the original post](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/x8h29g/hall_of_fame_doover_starting_in_1960_how_would/). The mods got back to me and gave me a thumbs up, so I'll try to post the new ballot every Monday, Wednesday and Friday if you want to try to keep up and have your uh very important voice on old NBA players be heard.

#Class of 1979

At long last, our streak of having inductees comes to a close. For the first time since 1971, there are no new inductees! Leading the way is Dave Bing, who wasn't horribly far off, collecting 70.0% of the vote. Walt Bellamy wasn't far behind either, notching 65.0% of the vote. Gail Goodrich led all the new comers, collecting 55.0% of the vote, but no one else came close to induction.

Not many people fell off either! The vast majority was just the crop of newcomers- Butch Beard, Charles Johnson, Curtis Rowe, Dick Snyder, Jim McMillian, Jim Price, Lucius Allen and Nate Williams are gone for good. After a few late ballot surges, Richie Guerin joins them, not making it on his 10th and last try- his final total, 22.2%, wasn't anywhere close to being good enough for induction.

**Larry Steele:** Guard. Portland Trail Blazers 1971-1980. 1x NBA Champion (1977 Portland Trail Blazers), 1x Steals Leader (1974). Career 8.2/2.9/2.8, Totals 5,009/1,781/1,719. Number retired by Portland. Was the NBA's first steals leader... fitting for a guy named Steele, I suppose.

Career 24.2/4.2/5.4, Totals 15,948/2,747/3,563. Member of the 75th anniversary team. NCAA all time leading scorer. Really, it's Pistol Pete- renown for his flashy passes and long range shooting, his legend speaks for himself. Career cut short by injuries, of course.

**Phil Jackson:** Power Forward. New York Knicks 1967-1978, New Jersey Nets 1978-1980. 1968 First Team All-Rookie, 2x NBA Champion (1970, 1973 New York Knicks), 2x DII All-American (66-67), 2x NCC Player of the Year (66-67), 3x First Team All-NCC (65-67).

#LAST CHANCE

The following player is on his 10th and final ballot- look over him closely, for if he doesn't reach 75%, he'll fall off permanently. 

**Bailey Howell (Y10, 25.0%):*** Power Forward. Detroit Pistons 1959-1964, Baltimore Bullets 1964-1966, Boston Celtics 1966-1970, Philadelphia 76ers 1970-1971. 6x All-Star (61-64, 66-67), 1x All-NBA Second Team (1963), 2x NBA Champion (1968-69 Boston Celtics), 1x Consensus First Team All-American (1959), 1x Consensus Second Team All-American (1958). Career 18.7/9.9/1.9, Totals 17,770/9,383/1,853. Unlike most of the hall of famers with end of career Celtics stints, Howell was very effective- averaged 20 and 10 in the 1968 playoffs, replacing Heinsohn in their hall of fame line-up. At the time of his retirement, was a top 10 scorer and rebounder of all time.

788,nba,"Last week, I posted the season results if 538's game-by-game winners won every time. I could've worded things better, and I got some feedback on that. So, hopefully this is more clear. This is not 538's official record predictions - this is based on going game-by-game, day-by-day, and assuming 538's predicted winner is victorious each and every time. When it comes down to playoffs, I go off 538's % of who will advance to the finals (ties in % broken by seeding/record), and then in the actual NBA finals, the winner is decided based on 538's % of who will win it all.

 I thought it'd be interesting to see the week-by-week changes at best, and at worst its just a useless exercise that I like to do. I apologize if I've done a poor job of explaining.

He picked up where he left off in 20/21, UNTIL the Solomon Hill injury against the Hawks. He never really looked healthy when he came back, so his metrics declined. Still, he finished top 10 in potential assists(14.4, using [nba.com](https://nba.com))  and the Lakers defense was [6 points better with him on the court.](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/1785/onoff#tab-team_efficiency)

At the time his agreement to sign with Miami was announced, I didn‚Äôt see how the addition of *just* Jimmy Butler, would turn a 39-win Heat team into a perennial playoff team. 

I was especially disappointed when it appeared Goran Dragic was apparently headed to Dallas in the sign-and-trade, as he was one of the Heat‚Äôs bright spots during an up-and-down Post-LeBron era.

However, that deal construction fell through and Hassan Whiteside wound up being the outgoing salary to Portland. Which also opened a starting spot up for Bam, who had shown flashes in his first two seasons.

Once the deal was finalized, the Heat officially entered the era that they are in now, which includes three consecutive trips to the playoffs, a trip to the Finals, a trip to the Eastern Conference Finals, ^(and a first round sweep that I‚Äôll gloss over very quickly.)

&gt;Russell Westbrook is a washed-up bricklayer who needs to be traded immediately for the Los Angeles Lakers to have any chance of saving their season.

Don‚Äôt worry, there‚Äôs plenty to go around! It‚Äôs a family-style meal of hate!

&gt;Westbrook is the obvious scapegoat. But there is plenty of blame to go around in Los Angeles. After all, it was Rob Pelinka who acquired Westbrook, and LeBron who pushed for the Lakers to acquire him two offseasons ago instead of better options like DeMar DeRozan or Hield. LeBron got what he wanted. And Pelinka signed off on it all and built this mess of a roster with a lack of shooters and reliable wing defenders. Team owner Jeanie Buss rewarded him with a four-year contract extension after he hired Ham. Lakers fans are right to rip Buss, Pelinka, and everyone else in the organization for their incompetency. The place was dumpster fire in the years prior to LeBron‚Äôs arrival, and since they won a title in 2020 they‚Äôve dismantled the roster. No matter how Westbrook evolves, and no matter who or what he‚Äôs eventually traded for, it‚Äôs difficult to trust the Lakers‚Äô leadership even if the owner‚Äôs last name is Buss.

And for dessert, something a bit tart?

&gt;And if Westbrook doesn‚Äôt make further changes, whether it‚Äôs with the Lakers or his next team, he‚Äôll be out of the NBA.

Despite LaMelo Ball being sidelined with a Grade 2 ankle sprain and Rozier recently suffering his own sprained ankle, the Hornets and coach Steve Clifford are off to a 2-1 start in the Eastern Conference.

&gt;The Lakers have also held preliminary discussions with the Spurs in recent weeks, sources said, showing interest in three-and-D wing Josh Richardson. The 6-foot-5 Richardson has averaged nearly 13 points to start the season, shooting 47.1 percent on 5.67 three-point attempts per game. So expect the Lakers to continue to keep tabs with the Spurs, Hornets and Pacers as a potential trade partner as the season wears on.

&gt;For now, the Lakers appear determined to give the current roster a proper sample size of 20-to-25 games and assess their needs. Lakers vice president of basketball operations Rob Pelinka is tasked with balancing the team‚Äôs current state versus the future when using the only two first-round picks eligible to be traded for the remainder of this decade. And for the Lakers, the proper deal will take patience, strategy, internal resolve and growth.

I didn‚Äôt realize until now that the Sixers are currently 0-3.. why is no-one talking about this?

They lost to a mediocre Spurs team a couple days ago and lost by 2 pts to the Bucks with a struggling Jrue Holiday And from what I know they‚Äôre just about fully healthy.

For anyone actively watching the Sixers this season, what‚Äôs the main reason for the early season struggles? You would think they‚Äôd have a bunch of momentum to start the season after their amazing offseason.

863,nba,"Now that each team has a few games under their belt which players have you been most impressed with to start the season? I've been doing my best to cycle through NBA League Pass but these are only players I have actually watched so far

1) Damian Lillard - Obvious homer pick, but this man picked up right where he left off before he got injured. Back to back 40 point games, hitting clutch shots and setting the tone for this new look Blazers team. He has been most impressive to me so far leading his team to 3-0 to start the season

2) Jayson Tatum - Dude looks pissed that his team lost in the finals last year and looks to be on a mission to get back at all costs. He is asserting his will on both ends and leading the league in scoring currently, I think it will be between him and Luka for MVP this year.

3) Paolo Banchero - Such a polished rookie, he already looks like he's been in the league for a few years. Just watched his first couple games but that poster he had was a fantastic way to cement his entry into the league.

4) Ja Morant - I honestly don't think anyone can truly stop Ja when he's got his mind set on going to the hoop. He looks like he's added to his bag over the offseason and his supporting cast is still one of the best in the league. He has one of the quickest behind the back dribbles I've seen and the fact he can keep the ball on a string going as fast as he does is crazy

5) Luka/Wood - Loving this 1, 2 punch early in the season. Not sure how much longer Wood will come off the bench but for now he is bullying those 2nd units. Luka continues to do Luka things and the NBA narrative looks to be heavily pushing him to win MVP this season. Once these two have more time to develop chemistry this could be Luka's dream P&amp;R partner",Players You've Been Most Impressed With

For example two point guards

Point guard A is surrounded by competent 3 point players. He makes 9 assist a game and they shoot those at a 40% clip.

Point Guard B is surrounded by incompetent 3 point players. He makes 8 assist a game and they shoot those at a 27% clip.

Stats would tell you point guard a is better but point guard B is just surrounded by worst shooters. 

If point guard A and B switched teams. Then point guard A would be getting 6.1 assist the game and point guard B would be getting 11.8 assist all other things being equal.

Or is screen printing how they‚Äôre made now and I‚Äôm just stupid/oblivious?",Jersey collecting?

Here's some of what I've heard:

‚Ä¢ Larry Bird wasn't good

‚Ä¢Bryant Reeves is one of the Worst NBA Players of all time, He wasn't even bad

‚Ä¢Oliver Miller is one of the Worst Players of all time

‚Ä¢From a Old BR Article in 2013 but They considered Al Horford one of the Worst starting Center in the league. They didn't provide a valid reason why, They just He needs to play PF and get someone else at Center

‚Ä¢Jeremy Lin is still better than 50% of the NBA

‚Ä¢ There should be a 4 team limit for how many times a player can be traded. This comment was on a TikTok Post about Ish Smith and How many teams He played for his career. The Commentor's reason was that Teams should be working with him and coaching him so that the problem he has is fixed so He doesn't need to get traded every time he finds a team. His Other reasons was that there should be a process that goes into it so a team can't just trade whenever they want, They should have a good reason to trade away a player",What are some of the Worst NBA Takes

DWade was a PNR player and having a stretch big who can pop or can roll to the basket and finish anywhere on the court or make the pass. I feel the possibilities on offense would be unlimited.

On defense Dirk was quick and a solid post defender while Wade being a great help side shot blocker they would shut down some guys.

A pure slasher scorer + a pure perimeter scorer. Both can post, both can play make, hit clutch shots and deadly from mid range.

971,nba,"To start the year off, the Lakers are 0-3, and currently rank last in just about every offensive category. While their defense has been decent, you can't win games in today's NBA with such a terrible offense. 

Westbrook is arguably the worst starter in the league, AD has regressed, and while Lebron has been playing well, he's going to be 38 years old, and has shown some signs of declining. Moreover, the team basically has no 3-point shooters: Lebron is currently the best shooter on the team. Opposing defenses are just packing up the paint and daring the Lakers to shoot. They have no offensive identity, and they don't really have any solid role-players or solid young talent.
